# TODO - Master Task List to Production

## üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - UPDATED 2025-06-28
1. **We've completed 26 major tasks** - The core system is built, tested, and operational
2. **Only 1 CRITICAL task remains** to go live (15 mins) - USB mount verification
3. **10 IMPORTANT features** for full functionality (3-4 hours)
4. **5 ENHANCEMENTS** for post-launch (4-6 hours)

The system is now 95% complete! We've successfully:

- ‚è≥ Only USB mount verification remains

**The system is operational and ready for use once USB verification is added!**

## üî¥ CRITICAL - MUST DO TO GO LIVE (15 mins remaining)

### 1. ‚úÖ Deploy Frontend to Static Directory - COMPLETED
- [x] Build frontend: `cd backup-frontend && npm run build`
- [x] Create static directory if missing: `mkdir -p backup-rust/static`
- [x] Copy built files: `cp -r backup-frontend/dist/* backup-rust/static/`
- [x] Test frontend loads at http://localhost:8888

### 2. ‚úÖ Wire Parallel Processing - COMPLETED
- [x] Modified BackupManager::start() to use TaskManager instead of direct workers
- [x] Initialized TaskManager with CPU core count workers
- [x] Changed manager.rs process_commands to dispatch to TaskManager
- [x] Ready to test multiple directories backup in parallel

### 3. ‚úÖ Implement Session Recovery - COMPLETED
- [x] In main.rs after storage init, call storage.get_latest_session()
- [x] If session exists and state is Running/Paused, load it into BackupManager
- [x] Tested - sessions restore with "paused" state for safety

### 4. ‚úÖ Test WebSocket Real Updates - COMPLETED
- [x] WebSocket connection established successfully
- [x] Real-time status updates flowing to frontend
- [x] Directory list with metadata transmitted
- [x] Frontend receives and displays updates

### 5. ‚úÖ Create USB Mount Verification - COMPLETED
- [x] Before backup starts, verify USB is mounted
- [x] Check path exists AND is a mount point (adapted for ChromeOS)
- [x] Show error in UI if USB not mounted
- [x] Add mount status to /api/status response
- [x] Changed to single incremental backup directory instead of daily directories
