# Gap Analysis: Current State to Production Ready

## ‚úÖ WORKING NOW
1. **Core Architecture** - Rust backend + React frontend compile and run
2. **Basic API** - Status, Start, Pause, Stop endpoints work
3. **WebSocket** - Real-time updates infrastructure in place
4. **Directory Scanning** - Scans home directory and calculates sizes
5. **Rsync Integration** - Actual rsync command execution with progress parsing
6. **USB Detection** - Path exists with previous backups

## üî¥ CRITICAL GAPS (Must Fix to Go Live)

### 1. Frontend Not Connected (30 mins)
- [ ] Build frontend: `cd backup-frontend && npm run build`
- [ ] Copy built files to `backup-rust/static/`
- [ ] Serve index.html from static files handler

### 2. Parallel Processing Not Active (1 hour)
- [ ] BackupManager should use TaskManager for parallel backups
- [ ] Currently processes directories sequentially via worker
- [ ] Need to wire: BackupManager ‚Üí TaskManager ‚Üí Multiple Workers

### 3. Session Persistence Missing (30 mins)
- [ ] Load previous session on startup from SQLite
- [ ] Currently starts fresh each time

### 4. WebSocket Updates Not Tested (30 mins)
- [ ] Verify real-time progress updates reach frontend
- [ ] Test with actual rsync operations

## üü° IMPORTANT GAPS (Should Fix Soon)

### 1. Profile Management (1 hour)
- [ ] Implement /api/profile endpoint
- [ ] Load/save profile selections
- [ ] Connect to frontend dropdown

### 2. Logs Collection (1 hour)
- [ ] Store rsync output in SQLite
- [ ] Implement /api/logs endpoint
- [ ] Display in LogsTab

### 3. History Tracking (1 hour)
- [ ] Record completed backups in backup_history table
- [ ] Implement history API endpoint
- [ ] Display in HistoryTab

### 4. Directory Selection (30 mins)
- [ ] Implement /api/select endpoint
- [ ] Update selected directories in session
- [ ] Persist selections

## üü¢ NICE TO HAVE (Post-Launch)

1. **Dynamic Scaling** - ResourceMonitor integration
2. **Schedule Feature** - Cron-like scheduling
3. **Dry Run Mode** - Test without copying
4. **Advanced Metrics** - Speed graphs, ETA calculations
5. **Error Recovery** - Retry failed directories

## QUICK GO-LIVE PLAN (2-3 hours)

### Step 1: Build & Deploy Frontend (15 mins)
```bash
cd backup-frontend
npm run build
cp -r dist/* ../backup-rust/static/
```

### Step 2: Wire Parallel Processing (45 mins)
- Modify BackupManager to use TaskManager
- Start N workers based on CPU cores
- Distribute directories to workers

### Step 3: Load Previous Session (30 mins)
- On startup, check SQLite for last session
- Resume from last state if interrupted

### Step 4: Test End-to-End (30 mins)
- Start backend: `cargo run --release`
- Open browser to http://localhost:8888
- Select directories and start backup
- Verify progress updates in UI

### Step 5: Create Start Script (15 mins)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/halcasteel/BACKUP-RSYNC/backup-rust
cargo run --release
```

## CURRENT BLOCKERS
1. ‚ùå Frontend not deployed to static/
2. ‚ùå Parallel processing bypassed
3. ‚ùå No session recovery
4. ‚úÖ USB device available at expected path

## TIME TO PRODUCTION: ~2-3 hours

The system is architecturally complete but needs these connections made. The "unused code" warnings are actually a sign that we built a comprehensive system - we just need to wire the pieces together!
